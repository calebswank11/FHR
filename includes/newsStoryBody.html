					AMES, Iowa – Flint Hills Resources sponsored the sixth annual Girls in Science Festival held Feb. 6 at the Science Center of Iowa in Des Moines. Statistically underrepresented in science and engineering career fields, the festival strives to educate and encourage young women to learn more about, and potentially pursue, careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

					Volunteers from Flint Hills Resources sites in Iowa and Minnesota demonstrated fun and interactive experiments for students and their families during the festival. “As an engineer, I am excited to be a part of this important program,” said Bekah Heit, project engineer at Flint Hills Resources Fairbank ethanol plant. “This is a wonderful opportunity to help mentor the next generation of scientists and engineers.”
